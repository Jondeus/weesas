              Change in buying processes, increased usage of digital services
              and the need seen in companies to build frictionless client
              experiences and services has given birth to a void in the markets.
              We’ve discovered a distinct call for a company, that is capable of
              designing and delivering different types of demanding
              technological solutions.
            </p>
            <h2>Why did we start a tech company?</h2>
            <p>
              According to studies by HubSpot the use of online services is
              increasing in a pace unheard of until now – at the same time the
              effectiveness of traditional sales activities is rapidly going
              down. This creates a scenario where a website becomes highly
              critical function for business. Therefore, business driving
              websites should host various different services that help their
              clients, like calculators, analyzing tools, ecommerce stores and
              other types of interactional resources to drive in sales and
              customers. All of these types of services helps in building a
              frictionless, easy and fast buyer’s journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Radical change means that you need to take advantage of data and
              technology in ways that we have not been doing before. In the end
              users world of digital products and services self-service is most
              often the best type of service and the potential customers expect
              more from the services than ever before. This is a great
              opportunity. Market shares are being shared online and companies
              that are able to make their clients buyers journey easier,
              succeed.

              continues to focus on being their customers partner in digital
              growth. Still offering services to increase traffic and developing
              digital sales and customer service. Newly launched Weesas focuses
              on serving datadriven websites and -services, web applications,
              integrations and high level technical expertise with HubSpot to
              support our clients growth and business. We are extremely proud of
              this new opportunity and most importantly our ability to answer
              the call heard from the market, which at the moment has a void to
              fill.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the main reasons behind the birth of Weesas is the lack of
              technical expertise around HubSpot across the globe. The technical
              knowledge what Weesas possesses is able to fill this gap between
              the needs of HubSpot clients and the technical knowhow offered.
              Weesas is not aiming to be a HubSpot partner, instead we offer a
              chance to all marketing - and HubSpot agencies to widen their
              service offerings with demanding technical endeavors.
