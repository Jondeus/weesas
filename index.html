                The way we develop websites always has two important aspects. We
                want the website or -service to look and feel as it is supposed
                to but just as important for us is to leave our customer with a
                product that they are able to maintain themselves unless we are
                needed to take care of it. Vendorlock is a curseword for us.

                Looking for a partner to help with your web development project?
                We got you covered. Building worldclass applications for web
                using modern battletested technologies is in our core.
              </p>
              <p>
                The structural foundation of an amazing web app is its
                architecture so that should always be the starting point. After
                that we move onto development sprints. Development sprints done,
                backlog empty, wishlist waiting for future. We're set to move
                into production.
              </p>
              <p>
                Speaking of production environments and hosting we either take
                care of your web app by simply hosting it or with broader needs
                up into 24/7 monitoring with blazing fast SLA's updating
                components that have been found in need of that. We also deliver
                products like these as "turnkey" so that our work ends at the
                delivery if you want to take care of the hosting and
                maintenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                We offer our know-how as white label service to agencies or we
                can take full control of the whole project from architecture,
                design and UX to development, testing and deployment.

              <h2>Technical HubSpot expertise and consultancy</h2>
              <p>
                We've been working with HubSpot for years all the way from the
                very early days (design manager v1 etc. #neverforget 🤘). Part
                of our core business is working in and on top of HubSpot in
                order to meet our clients goals. Whether it is providing
                training and consultancy or developing extensions into HubSpot
                and integrating HubSpot with other systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                HubSpot is a powerful suite of tools in itself but what often
                gets neglected is that HubSpot thanks to their philosophy
                provides the means to build upon their great foundation if
                needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                To spark a few ideas we can for example increase the
                capabilities of HubSpot's CRM system by creating HubSpot
                extensions getting functionalities and data from external system
                right into your HubSpot CRM.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to bestpractices of using HubSpot day to day to
                integrating HubSpot into other systems and everything in
                between. We got you. We provide easy to digest and reliable
                guidance with your HubSpot needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                We specialize in white label services for HubSpot agencies in
                need of widening their service offering to more technical realm
                of things. Or helping out in design, development, delivery &

              <h2>Integrations</h2>
              <p>
                Integrations when done and designed right bring the strengths of
                all connected systems to end users without the need of jumping
                back and forth between systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have few preferred integration platform providers that we're
                partnered with. Using those existing foundations we tackle the
                most commonly needed integration cases. With projects that
                require more tailored solutions we've built the needed
                integration from scratch.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've successfully delivered countless integrations of all sizes
                most often HubSpot is the other or one of the connected systems.
                Which has given us a really solid grasp on HubSpots API and the
                possibilities it offers.
              </p>
              <p>
                One quite often needed example is an integration between HubSpot
                CRM and other 3rd party CRM let's take MS Dynamics as an
                example. Marketing works inside HubSpot and leads should
                seamlessly flow from there to the other CRM system which sales
                use and from the actions of salesreps provide feedback back into
                HubSpot and so forth.<br />Business works as it should and all
                parties get to work with the tools they get the most out of in
                order to take care of their responsibilities.

                <p>
                  Web service for providing investor information for their end
                  users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our client wanted to be able to serve information for
                  investors on a web service. End users should be able to get a
                  broad view of all the latest news and events from all listed
                  companies. As well as dig deeper into a single company with
                  vast amounts of information about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also important was a subscription feature where end users
                  could subscribe to get all the upcoming news and events from
                  the companies they've chosen.
                </p>
                <h4>Our solution</h4>
                <p>
                  First off we researched the 3rd party data sources and how we
                  could operate with them. We also decided on the arcitecture of
                  needed server and the solutions that send and recieve data in
                  order to serve that to the front-end.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We decided to tackle this with server running Node.js and we
                  built a custom API that recieves requests from the web service
                  built with HubSpot CMS and sends back requested data. This
                  server then handles the data flow with the 3rd party data
                  sources and caches the recieved and served information
                  depending on what piece of data from the big dataset is in
                  question. We were also tasked to provide hosting as well as
                  monitoring and logging solutions for this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Static information in this project that is not updated
                  constantly we store in HubDB table and serve the content from
                  there.

                <h4>Clients request</h4>
                <p>
                  Client requested to get a centralized source for information
                  about their vendors and personnel at these vendor locations.
                  Having the data centralized we can then pull the information
                  into necessary locations on the website and maintenance is
                  done at one singular location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On top of the database for vendor locations and their staff
                  our client needed to get an interactive map with multi level
                  filtering that shows real time view of their vendor database
                  results.
                </p>
                <h4>Our solution</h4>
                <p>
                  We designed the necessary tables to be created with HubDB and
                  what information to store in those.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Development of the front-end components to create a "listing
                  view" for the vendors which has the interactive map element
                  showing the locations of all the vendors and bundled into that
                  we developed a multi-level filtering based on cities, provided
                  services and free text input search.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Client also needed to have a vendor specific subpages. We set
                  the vendors HubDB table to dynamically create subpages based
                  on the HubDB table rows in order to fully automatize the
                  maintenance side of things when it comes to vendor subpages.

                <h4>Clients request</h4>
                <p>
                  Client wanted a website built with HubSpot CMS. 👍
                </p>
                <h4>Our solution</h4>
                <p>
                  We recieve the design which we can provide consultancy with
                  regards of what type of components could be smart to build
                  into specified use cases. Design is most often either provided
                  by our client or we've collaborated in the project with
                  <a href="https://www.salescommunications.fi/" target="_blank"
                    >Salescommunications Finland Oy</a
                  >
                  and design is provided by them. After we've gone through the
                  designs we plan out the necessary templates and modules to be
                  built.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Depending on the project deadlines we might start to build the
                  components and templates that consists the bulk of the website
                  in order to get those ready for content first.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By keeping things as modular as possible we will end the
                  project with our client having tools to create countless
                  variations thus creating an end results where our client will
                  be able to create new resources by themselves by mix and
                  matching the developed modules.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are also very familiar following more demanding
                  requirements from some clients like for example in
                  accessibility WCAG 2.0 standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Majority of the projects need that we are also in charge of
                  testing and publishing the website.

                  Not able to fully move onto HubSpot yet. Marketing will be
                  moving on HubSpot from the start but sales department remains
                  to work in their current CRM system for time being.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Business has to function seamlessly even though data will be
                  gathered in two separate systems. Marketing has to be able to
                  fully function using HubSpot without the need of jumping back
                  and forth between systems and they must be able to get
                  feedback from sales out of the leads they generate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sales department will be fed with leads from marketing
                  straight onto the system that they remain to use and as they
                  progress with leads specified information will be
                  bi-directionally synced between the two systems. Marketing and
                  Sales processes will be positively shaken and rattled in order
                  to increase the effectiveness of them via this integration
                  project enabling those two departments to create a mutual
                  understanding of what data needs to flow and where.
                </p>
                <h4>Our solution</h4>
                <p>
                  If our client does not have existing integration architecture
                  and field mappings to provide us we start our project with
                  that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Get all stakeholders who are affected by the integration
                  project around the same table and decide on what scenarios the
                  integration is supposed to handle and what data is being moved
                  and into what direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the planning phase of architecture and fieldmapping we
                  document everything and give that to our client for future
                  reference and use the documented "blueprint" to build the
                  integration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We do the necessary testing in order to make sure integration
                  functions as planned. In most cases we take care of hosting
                  and moving the integration into production.
